                <p>This is my personal digital garden—a space where I cultivate and share my thoughts, projects, and explorations as they grow. Unlike a traditional blog with polished, chronological posts, this is a more organic collection of ideas in various stages of development.</p>
                <p>Here you'll find everything from rough notes and half-formed thoughts to more polished essays and completed projects. Some pieces are seedlings just taking root, while others have been cultivated over time into more mature works. Everything is open to evolution and growth as my understanding deepens.</p>
                <p>Think of this space as an interconnected knowledge garden rather than a feed of content. Feel free to wander the paths between ideas, following your curiosity rather than chronology. You might stumble upon works-in-progress, experimental projects, or deeper documentation of my learning journey.</p>
                <p>I believe in learning and creating in public, so you'll see my thought process exposed here—including the messy parts. Each piece includes indicators of its development stage and last update, so you'll know what you're exploring.</p>
                <p>Feel free to explore, and I hope you discover something interesting as you wander through these growing ideas.</p>
